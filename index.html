     <h1>Nikki's favorite things</h1>
     <h3 class="important">A blanket named khargooshi</h3>
     <p class="first"> She loved it more than everything in the world, we believe that she could get relax and calm with touching this and it is indeed a pacifier to her mind and body, She used it everywhere like:
       <ul>
         <li>in her crib</li>
         <li>in the car</li>
         <li>while playing</li>
         <li>while feeding</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <h3 class="second">The pacifier</h3>
      <p> She nags for it, it makes her pacify, She wont go to bed without this and she likes it in second position after her blanky, we have to prepare her to quit using it soon before turning to two.</p>
      <h3 class="third"> The kitty named miew miew</h3>
      <p> She took the miew miew out with herself and she also loves to talk to her, feed her, put her pacifier in kitty's mouth.</p>
